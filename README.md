pituitary adenoma IHC data and analysis (NO PHI), Tpit and ontology

The goal of this project is to incorporate Tpit IHC data into an existing data set that includes the IHC results of about 150 pituitary adenomas. 

The prior data included IHC of SF-1, Pit-1, ACTH, CAM5.2, prolactin, growth hormone, TSH, LH, FSH, and a few other IHC markers.
